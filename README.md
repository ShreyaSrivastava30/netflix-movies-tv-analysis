# netflix-movies-tv-analysis
Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing of the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing text fields, and converting date formats. The cleaned dataset is prepared for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and further modeling or visualization tasks.


Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
This project involves cleaning and preparing the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset for analysis. The following key data preprocessing steps have been completed:

Missing Values: Identified missing values using .isnull() and handled them appropriately by filling or removing based on context.

Duplicate Rows: Removed duplicate records using .drop_duplicates() to ensure data uniqueness and integrity.

Date Format Conversion: Converted date columns to a consistent datetime format (e.g., dd-mm-yyyy) for uniformity and easier analysis.

Column Renaming: Cleaned column headers by making them lowercase and removing spaces to ensure consistency and easier access.

Data Types: Checked and corrected data types for columns.

These preprocessing steps ensure the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
